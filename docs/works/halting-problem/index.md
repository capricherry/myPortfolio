#  Will it appear or will it represent forever?
## Finn Geiger

By running a cellular automaton on paintings by Paul Cèzanne, this series of works asks questions about the meaning of computation in art.

> However, we must note that art, as a means of expression and as awakening of the cultural awareness of technical ensembles, is limited; art goes through [aesthesis] and is therefore naturally inclined to grasp the object, tool, instrument, or machine; but true technicity, that which can be integrated into culture, is not in the manifest. All the prestigious color photographs of sparks, of fumes, all the recordings of noise, sounds, or images, generally remain a use [exploitation] of technical reality and not a revelation of this reality. Technical reality must be thought, and even be known through participation in its schemas of action; aesthetic feeling can emerge, but only after this intervention of real intuition and participation and not as a fruit of a mere spectacle: every technical spectacle remains puerile and incomplete if it is not preceded by the integration into the technical ensemble.

## Project Overview

**Abstract / Short Description**
  
The project with the working title „Will it appear or will it represent forever?“ is understood as a series of works. At the heart of all of them lies the same Turing-complete and colored cellular automaton. The individual works consist of a computer and a screen running an instance of that automaton where the initial state of each instance is a digital replication of a painting of Cèzanne. Once the computational process of a work started, it will only continue and never restart. If a work gets shut down it will store its last state and will continue at that exact state when booted again. What is shown is the impossibility to predict wether an instance will hold in one state, loop in a repeating sequence of states or run endlessly without any repeating sequence of states. Thus following Fazi’s argumentation for a contingent computation we might experience computation’s inhering and very own capacity of producing something new. Will there be any artistic value in this computational process?

## Motivation & Context

**Contingent Computation**

Will it halt or will it loop forever? This is the famous halting problem. The problem through which Alan Turing invented the theoretical construct which is the foundation for modern computers: the Turing Machine. „Will it halt or will it loop forever?“ asks for the computability of a problem. For every mathematically describable problem one can ask wether there exists a machine - an algorithm - that solves this problem mechanically or wether there is none. And the ultimate machine would be a machine that solves the halting problem itself by being able to decide for any machine in combination with any input wether this combination leads to a result or wether it will loop forever. But there exists no such „ultimate“ machine and its inexistence defines the boundaries of computation. Turing - together with Gödel and probably before them already Cantor - showed that mathematics is far from being closed in itself. It is a specific understanding of logico-quantitative infinity which broke with the notion of mathematics as a closed system but which is at the same time necessary to construct a mathematical system powerful enough to be a subject of research. Thus even though mathematics still is by its nature purely deductive, deductive does not mean that there are definitive answers to every question or that there even exist an answer to every question. Traditionally the incapability to find a solution to the halting problem has been read as a failure of mathematical and computational systems. But we can shift our perspective on this logical phenomenon: the halting problem introduces an irreducibility to computation; there exist computation because you cannot shortcut it in an arbitrary way through the use of an ultimate machine: every algorithm has to run in order to produce the process of computation which either leads to a result or loops forever. And still for us it is impossible to know wether the computational process runs forever or if it just takes some more steps to finish. Now the shift of perspective can happen as soon as we acknowledge that this undecidability makes computation the only force capable to „decide“ wether a certain problem has an answer or not. From this perspective computation produces itself and thus produces something new, something that could not have been thought in advance. This perspective is a rephrased version of what M. Beatrice Fazi proposes in her book „Contingent Computation“. What Fazi emphasises with this perspective is an understanding of computation in which computation is something separate from human. Computation is not simply an extension of human (in the McLuhanian sense) but it has its own inherent becoming; Computation, as well as mathematics, cannot only be constructed by human but it dictates a certain direction of development by its formal rules it is constituted by. Mathematics and computation form in themselves their own appearance despite from their capacity to represent empirical phenomena. Although it is important to not conflate this appearance with a platonistic idea of mathematics. There is no world of pure ideas even though we might find mathematical structures in our environment for example in form of the Fibonacci sequence. Where this appearance actually happens (in „nature“ or in human perception) is a totally different question. What stays untouched from the question of an ontological origin of mathematics is the appearance itself that I try to highlight which is in its logical, quantitative and formal nature contingent as Fazi shows in that sense that its coming into existence was possible but could have been totally different. Could we understand computation then as a medium? And could we ask for its artistic qualities, specificities and meaning in a similar way as artists asked for in the 20th century regarding the result, process, and materiality of painting? Would such an enquiry into computations be a means to rearrange our relation to computation itself and to computational technologies at large? A relation that is so much bound to Silicon Valley futurism (which lately became obviously problematic) and to a pre-Gödelian understanding of logic and mathematics. A relation that renders individuals as mere users both because companies design digital technologies in order construct structures of power and because individuals do not engage with computation itself as a topic of interest and thus stuck in this pre-Gödelian understanding of a mathematics in which there logicians believed in a closed system with an answer to every question. Gilbert Simondon already saw this double movement in his book On the Modes of Existence of Technical Objects in which he repeatedly writes of the issue that culture excludes technical objects:

> Culture is unbalanced because it recognizes certain objects, like the aesthetic object, granting them citizenship in the world of significations, while it banishes other objects (in particular technical objects) into a structureless world of things that have no signification but only a use, a utility function. Confronted by such a defensive rejection, pronounced by a partial and biased culture, men who have knowledge of technical objects and who appreciate their signification seek to justify their judgment by granting the technical object the only status currently valued besides that of the aesthetic object, namely that of the sacred object. This, then, gives rise to an intemperate technicism which is nothing other than idolatry of the machine and which, through this idolatry, by means of identification, leads to a technocratic aspiration to unconditional power. The desire for power consecrates the machine as a means of supremacy, it makes of it a modern philter. The man who wants to dominate his peers calls the android machine into being. He thus abdicates before it and delegates his humanity to it. He seeks to construct a thinking machine, dreams of being able to build a volition machine, a living machine, in order to retreat behind it without anxiety, freed of all danger, exempt from all feelings of weakness, and triumphant through the mediation of what he invented. In this case, however, the machine, after having become, according to the imagination, the robot, this duplicate of man devoid of interiority, quite evidently and inevitably represents a purely mythical and imaginary being.

**Cèzanne and the Motive**

We can find the question of where things actually appear in the history of art. It was Paul Cèzanne who painted the same mountain and the same fruits over and over again. All the while he freed his painting from the pure meaning of representation. He reduced his palette of colors. Shapes would start to appear through almost geometrical areas of colors; inverting the hierarchy of form and color. His brush strokes ended being horizontally and vertically only. He left blank spots of canvas visible. He kept the Mount Sainte-Victoire on his paintings but instead of representing it he kept it as a motive. The actual paintings of the late Cèzanne show a reflection on perception and paintings. What is represented on the painting became a point of departure, no more and no less. Now when receiving Cèzannes work we may encounter the question if the motive that is visible on his painting actually appears on his painting or wether it actually appears in our process of perception? What this question actually reveals is the function of representation and by showing this function they open up possibilities for what a painting might be. These possibilities became actual opportunities for artists since then. Artists who extended the idea of painting. Cubisms, Abstraction, Expressionism to name only a few are all rooted in Cèzannes groundbreaking work. 

**Computation as Artistic Medium**

From these two branches - Fazi’s ontology of a contingent computation and Cèzannes work on painting - I want to develop a series of works of art which I will lay out in the following. For it I rephrase the halting problem, completely decontextualise, strip of its logic but keep it as a reference: Will it appear or will it represent forever? Will it, computation, appear as an artistic method, material and outcome or is there no possibility for computation to be something autonomous beside representing idea and making them operable. This is a tough problem to tackle and it feels like reverse engineering the problem when trying to apply Cèzannes Œuvre to computation. It is probably also important to mention that everything Fazi argues in Contingent Computation takes place in an extra-empirical realm. A realm that cannot be experienced other then by computation. But who said computation is only left to what we call today computers. Computation is a process that can be executed by a human equipped with pen and paper strictly following an algorithm. Still executing a computation with pen and paper makes one only partaking in the process of computation; computation remains in its very own realm defined by the algorithm. But I claim that partaking in processes of computation enables a productive relationship with computation through experience but - to speak with Simondon - one that should not be left to a mere technical understanding but one that grants these objects and processes „citizenship in the world of significations“. If it was possible to develop an aesthetic understanding of computation as computation meaningful for artists this aesthetic would need to include something like Fazi’s extra-empirical realm. Simondon knew this condition whereby I would like to note that the aesthetics I’m looking for is not about beauty but aesthesis:

> This is why the discovery of the beauty of technical objects cannot be left to perception alone: the function of the object needs to be understood and thought; in other words, a technical education is needed if the beauty of technical objects is to appear as an integration of technical schemas into a universe, within the key-points of this universe. How, for instance, could the beauty of a radio relay placed on a mountain, and oriented toward another mountain where another relay is placed, appear to the one who only sees a tower of mediocre height, with a parabolic grid in which a very small dipole is placed? All of these figural structures need to be understood as emitting and receiving the bundle of directed waves that propagates from one tower to another, through the clouds and the fog; it is with respect to this invisible, imperceptible, and real, actual transmission that the whole [ensemble] formed by the mountains and the towers is beautiful, for the towers are placed at the key-points of the two mountains in order to constitute the wireless cable; this type of beauty is as abstract as that of a geometric construction, and the function of the object needs to be understood in order for its structure, and the relation of this structure with the world, to be correctly imagined, and aesthetically felt.“

##  Approach

After having introduced (1) the notion of a contingent computation granting computation an ontological autonomous status, (2) an interpretation of Cèzannes Œuvre as being a key point in art history where painting appeared as a question about itself being a medium, and (3) bringing the first two point into a hopefully productive connection in the form of the question concerning computation as an artistic medium, I now want to describe the project itself. The basic idea of the project is to take the questions posed above and bring them into a running piece of artistic software. The formulation of these questions will take place in the form of cellular automata. Cellular automata are grids of often rectangular cells which have a state. By applying certain (mostly simple) rules the cells change there state in fixed time steps. Through repeatedly applying these rules for every time step, the cells on the grid compute and show static, moving and alternating patterns. The probably most famous cellular automaton is Conway’s Game of Life. Such a cellular automaton is ideally to bridge between visual arts and computation as it is visually perceivable but it also computes without directly or necessarily representing anything. Conway might took inspiration from certain features of cells but the actual automaton detaches from these features.

The project with the working title „Will it appear or will it represent forever?“ is understood as a series of works. At the heart of all of them lies the same Turing-complete and colored cellular automaton. The individual works consist of a computer and a screen running an instance of that automaton where the initial state of each instance is a digital replication of a painting of Cèzanne. Once the computational process of a work started, it will only continue and never restart. If a work gets shut down it will store its last state and will continue at that exact state when booted again. What is shown is the impossibility to predict wether an instance will hold in one state, loop in a repeating sequence of states or run endlessly without any repeating sequence of states. Thus following Fazi’s argumentation for a contingent computation we might experience computation’s inhering and very own capacity of producing something new. Will there be any artistic value in this computational process?

At this point I want to outline the two conditions for my artistic inquiry. Conditions might not sound like something that belongs to an artistic process but more to a mathematical one. But since the medium of computation is a formal medium and since I want to reflect on this formal medium I am forced to adapt to its formal character.

**Undecidable, uncomputability and Turing Completeness**

Because the kind of computation that Fazi analysis and describes is tightly bound to the mathematical concepts of uncomputability and thus also undecidability I have to incorporate them rigorously into my project. If I want to ask questions about contingent computation than the computational system that I plan to build will need to have the properties needed for computation to be contingent. To prove that a certain mathematical system (axiomatic system) is undecidable and capable of expressing uncomputable problem is a pretty complex undertaking. Luckily one can prove an axiomatic system to have the properties of undecidability and uncomputability if it is capable of expressing a Turing Machine. This still is a complex thing to do but it does not involve formal mathematical proving skills. As described above, everything that can be computed can be computed by a Turing Machine. There is a term for axiomatic systems that can compute everything computable which is: Turing Completeness. If an axiomatic system is decidable and computable the halting problem isn’t a problem anymore as every combination of program and input can be proved to halt or not to halt. Thus the artistic computational system I’m proposing has to be Turing-complete. Only then computation can be understood contingent following Fazi. 

**Extra-empirical / computation only / No sensor data**

The second condition I set for this project is it being restricted computation only. There is no user input nor any other kind of sensor data. This is important in order to emphasise the extra-empirical realm Fazi highlights. I explicitly wrote emphasise because strictly speaking it is not necessary to exclude sensor data computation would still be contingent (as long as the system has the properties of undecidability and uncomputability). But in order to focus the questions and meanings of this project I feel the need to focus as much as possible on this abstract thing which we call computation.
